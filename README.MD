# SCHNETJAX

Here, I try to implement the SchNet architecture in JAX/FLAX from scratch, and train a little database of water molecules.

TO-DO THINGS:

- Firstly, the model does not converge. I think it has to do with the filter generator or the convolutional layer, so I need to check that part very closely.

- Generate filter plots.

- Add initializers (normal) to the embeddings.
